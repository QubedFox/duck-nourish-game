# Duck Nourish

This was a quick project made partially based off Your first 2D game tutorial from the Godot 4.x docs. The mechanics were then changed so that I could add mechanics and learnings from outside the tutorial.

All art and programming is done by myself, with no generative AI used in the development process.

The game is publicly available to play at itch.io: [https://qb-fox.itch.io/duck-nourish](https://qb-fox.itch.io/duck-nourish)
